Echo3 is a light-weight open-source framework for developing rich single-page web applications.

The server-side Java API enables fast &amp; complex client/server applications using a
Swing-style component API. The identical JavaScript API allows the easy development of
pure client-side applications using the very same clean and intuitive programming model.
New components can be easily adopted for both platforms.
