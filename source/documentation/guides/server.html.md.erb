## Server-Side Java Applications

This section introduces the developer to creating web applications with Echo3 using 
server-side Java code. This approach has your code running entirely on the server,
in a Java servlet container. The code will never be exposed to the client and can be trusted.

### Assumptions

This tutorial assumes that you are reasonably familiar with the basics of Java software development.
You will need some beginner-level knowledge of server-side web development with Java, notably
the ability to install a Java Servlet Container and deploy servlets to it. Building the included
sample requires the use of the Apache Ant build tool.
